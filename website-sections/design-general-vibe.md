# Design General Vibe

## E-Invoice Micro-SaaS (ZUGFeRD / XRechnung)

This document defines the **overall design direction, emotional tone, and visual vibe** of the product.  
It is intentionally **non-technical**, but precise enough to guide UI decisions, copywriting, illustrations, and future brand assets.

Think of this as the **design north star** that every screen, component, and interaction must align with.

---

## 1. Core Design Intention

### What this product should feel like

- Calm
- Reliable
- Professional
- Focused
- Modern, but not trendy

This is **accounting-adjacent software**.  
Users must trust it with **financial documents, compliance, and legal obligations**.

The UI should never feel:

- playful
- experimental
- flashy
- “startup-hype”
- marketing-heavy

---

## 2. Mental Model

### The product should feel like:

> “A clean, well-organized desk where invoices are processed calmly and correctly.”

Not:

- a finance influencer dashboard
- a creative design tool
- a bloated enterprise ERP

But:

- a precise, purpose-built instrument

---

## 3. Emotional Goals

When a user opens the app, they should feel:

1. **Relief**  
   “Okay, this looks manageable.”

2. **Confidence**  
   “This software knows what it’s doing.”

3. **Control**  
   “I can clearly see what’s happening with my invoices.”

4. **Speed without stress**  
   “Things move fast, but nothing feels rushed.”

---

## 4. Visual Personality

### Overall Aesthetic

- Light mode first
- Neutral, low-saturation colors
- High contrast for text and data
- Plenty of whitespace

### UI Density

- Medium density
- Optimized for reading tables and forms
- Never cramped, never oversized

### Shape Language

- Soft-rounded corners
- Straight lines
- No exaggerated curves
- No sharp, aggressive edges

---

## 5. Typography Vibe

Typography should communicate:

- seriousness
- clarity
- modern professionalism

Guidelines:

- Sans-serif
- Excellent numeric readability
- No decorative fonts
- No playful typefaces

Text should feel:

- neutral
- precise
- calm

Headlines should **not shout**.  
Body text should **not feel heavy**.

---

## 6. Color & Contrast Philosophy

### Color Usage

- Color is **functional**, not decorative
- Used to communicate:
  - status
  - focus
  - hierarchy
- Never used just to “make things pretty”

### Contrast

- Strong contrast for:
  - text
  - tables
  - form labels
- Subtle contrast for:
  - backgrounds
  - cards
  - separators

### Status Colors

- Muted, professional
- No neon
- No pure red/green fills
- Always paired with text/icons

---

## 7. Layout & Composition

### Page Structure

- Predictable layouts
- Clear hierarchy
- Consistent spacing

Users should never ask:

- “Where am I?”
- “What should I do next?”

### Whitespace

- Generous but intentional
- Used to separate concepts
- Used to reduce cognitive load

Whitespace is not “empty” — it is **structure**.

---

## 8. Motion & Interaction Feel

### Motion Philosophy

- Subtle
- Purpose-driven
- Never decorative

Motion should:

- confirm an action
- indicate a state change
- guide attention briefly

Motion should never:

- distract
- entertain
- slow the user down

---

## 9. Copy & Language Vibe

### Tone

- Professional
- Direct
- Calm
- Helpful

### Language Rules

- No buzzwords
- No marketing fluff
- No legal jargon unless unavoidable
- Short sentences
- Clear instructions

Example:

- ❌ “Unlock next-level invoice automation”
- ✅ “Your invoice has been processed.”

---

## 10. What This Product Is NOT

This product should **not** feel like:

- A crypto dashboard
- A creative design SaaS
- A marketing website
- An enterprise ERP from the early 2000s
- A playful startup landing page

---

## 11. Reference Vibe (Visual Inspiration)

To help align visually, look for inspiration in products that feel:

- Calm
- Technical
- Trustworthy
- Minimal

### Good Reference Categories

- Modern accounting tools
- Developer-focused SaaS
- Compliance-heavy software with good UX

### If you want concrete visual inspiration, I recommend:

- Stripe (dashboard & docs)
- Linear (UI clarity & calmness)
- Vercel (docs & layout discipline)
- GitHub (tables, data-heavy UI)
- Modern banking dashboards (EU fintech)
  > - layout rules
  > - component behavior
  > - spacing
  > - typography
  > - interaction patterns

---

## 12. Decision Filter (Very Important)

When making any design decision, ask:

1. Does this increase clarity?
2. Does this increase trust?
3. Does this reduce cognitive load?
4. Would this still feel appropriate in 5 years?

If the answer to any is “no” → don’t do it.

---

## 13. Summary

This product’s design should feel like:

- a quiet expert
- a reliable assistant
- a professional tool that does one job extremely well

No drama.  
No noise.  
Just clarity, structure, and confidence.
